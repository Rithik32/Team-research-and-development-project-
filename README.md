# Team A217 – 7COM1079 Research and Development Project

This repository contains the work completed by Group A217 for the DS093 project under the module 7COM1079 – Team Research and Development at the University of Hertfordshire.

## Research Question
Is there a statistically significant correlation between Year and Total Deaths in Brazil during the period 1990–2019?

## Project Overview
This project investigates long-term mortality trends in Brazil using data from 1990 to 2019. The study examines whether total annual deaths show a consistent statistical relationship with time. The work completed includes:

- Extracting and preparing the DS093 dataset  
- Performing statistical analysis using Pearson’s correlation  
- Testing normality with the Shapiro–Wilk test  
- Creating visualisations (scatter plot and histogram)  
- Conducting background research and reviewing relevant literature  
- Producing the final written report  
- Collaborating through GitHub to document contributions
